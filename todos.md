For Valentin,
these are a list of possible improvement that could be done.
Don't pay attention to it, or do if you really want ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## FIXMEs
there is nothing to fix (...yet)

## TODOs

- [x] examples
	- [x] an item that scrolls along the canvas (probably overpaint the canvas)
	- [x] chapters
  - [x] map
  - [x] do an operation for each element of a datastructure
  - [x] import a json file into a variable
- [x] sort the current examples and rename them appropriately
	- [x] do an index.html page for the examples
- [ ] comment the current examples
- [ ] write a sheet of "how we can work on this"
	- [ ] they gotta learn to break problems into smaller problems
- [ ] exercises
	- [ ] country flags
	- [ ] for looping through objects to show them, the BnB of dataviz
